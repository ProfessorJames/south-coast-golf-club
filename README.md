## Design Choices

### Fonts
To enhance typography, [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") were employed. 
[Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat "Montserrat") was selected for text in the Course section and for the Logo. 
The rest of the website was styled with [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto "Roboto") to create a distinct separation from the text in the course section and Logo.


## Colours

I have selected the colours for the website manually. I had a picture in my mind what the website would look like before starting coding. These colours seem like a good fit for a Golf Course in Ireland, with a use of green and golds throughout the website. For text and styling I have used a number of grays to provide subtle contrast where needed.

![Colour Pallete](/assets/docs/readme/colour-pallette.png)

| CSS Variable Name | Hex Code | Comment |
|---|---|---|
| green | `#004225` | Used as a background colour for header, nav, contact and location sections. Also used as a text colour for some section headings. |
| gold | `#DAA520` | Used to colour the double border in nav and header section. Also used to style labels in contact form, and to add hover effects for social media icons. |
| yellow | `#E8AB16` | Used to style contact text in Contact & Location sections. |
| #ffd700 | `metallic-gold` | Used to style hover effect on form submit button. |
| black | `#000` | Used as background colour for footer section. Also used to style award paragraph in Course section. |
| dark-gray | `#666` | Used to style paragraph text in Course section. |
| gray | `#ccc` | Used to style borders for Gallery images and form-input fields. |
| silver | `#c0c0c0` | Used to style borders for div in Membership section. |
| light-gray | `#f0f0f0` | Used as a background colour in Membership Benefits and Membership Plans sections. |
| white | `#FFFFFF` | Used as background colour throughout site and to style text across website. |

Note:  The colour pallette image was generated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors"). There is a discrepancy between the color variable names I have used in the CSS variable names and the names that Coolors has given the colours. The reason for this is because the Colour pallette from Coolors was generated after the CSS and CSS variable names had been written for the website.

### Icons
In our project, we've enriched the user interface by incorporating icons sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"), a widely-used icon library. These icons provide visual cues and enhance the overall user experience. They are carefully chosen and thoughtfully placed to improve the clarity and aesthetics of the website.

### Structure

This project follows a mobile-first design approach, with a focus on ensuring that the website looks and functions well on smaller screens. The primary reference point for styling is the Galaxy Fold, with a screen width of 280px. 

To create a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes, we use breakpoints inspired by Bootstrap. These breakpoints help us optimize the layout and styling of our website for different devices and screen widths.
You can find more information about Bootstrap breakpoints in their official documentation [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Testing

Testing was essential to ensure the website functions correctly and meets the desired user experience. The following testing was conducted throughout the development of the website:

1. Navigation
* Homepage: Verified that the homepage loads without errors, and all navigation links, such as the header menu and footer links, work as expected.

* Thank-you page: Verified that the thank-you page loads without errors when a user submits a form. Tested that thank-you page redirects automatically back to the home page after 10 seconds. Also tested that if users click on home icon they will be brought to home page.

* Internal Links: Tested navigation to internal sections (Logo, Home, Course, Membership, Gallery & Contact Us) to confirm they load correctly and the navigation is consistent throughout the site.

2. Forms and User Input
* Contact Form: Tested the contact form, ensuring users can submit inquiries or messages successfully. Validated that form fields have proper validation and error handling.

* User Inputs: Tested all input fields in Contact Form with valid and invalid inputs to ensure proper validation and error messages.

3. Content and Functionality
* Text Content: Reviewed all text content for accuracy, grammar, and spelling.

* Images and Iframe: Ensured that images and iframe load correctly and display as intended.

4. Responsive Design
* Mobile Devices: Tested the website on various mobile devices (e.g., galaxy fold, smartphones and tablets) to ensure that it is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.
* Logo: The text for the Logo section was initially causing problems with the display of the hero image when changing between larger device sizes. After consideration, it was decided to shorten the Logo text from "South Coast Golf Club" to "SCGC" to address this issue.  

* Desktop: Tested the website on large screen sizes to ensure that it is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes.

* Browser Compatibility: Verified that the website functions correctly on different web browsers (Chrome, Edge & Firefox) to ensure cross-browser compatibility.

5. Cross-Device Testing
* Tested the website on various devices and screen sizes to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience across platforms.

6. Validation

* Each line of code been meticulously reviewed. Changes were made where necessary, and we're thrilled to report that our work has received unanimous approval from the W3C validators.
  
  (i) HTML (index.html) validator results

    ![HTML Validator](assets/docs/readme/HTML-validate.png)

  (ii) CSS (style.css) validator results
  
    ![CSS Validator](assets/docs/readme/CSS-validate.png)

7. Performance & Accessibility Best Practices

    By adhering to accessibility best practices, we can ensure that our website provides an excellent user experience to a wide range of users.

     ![Lighthouse Report](assets/docs/readme/Lighthouse-report.png)

    We note that there is room for improvement on the performance score (72). An area for focus in the future will be to improve times for:
      (i) First Contentful Paint, 
      (ii) Largest Contentful Paint, 
      (iii) Total Blocking Time, and
      (iv) Speed Index 

    This will be done as our development skills and knowledge increase. 

8. Linter Settings
    
    The default linter setting on CodeAnywhere were changing the layout for HTML code. Added .prettierrc file and updated settings in IDE to ehance formatting of HTML document in line with industry best practice - HTML code is now layed out like a 'Christmas Tree'.
    

## Bugs

   1.  Web Accessibility testing - When running the website through [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://professorjames.github.io/south-coast-golf-club/ "WAVE") it was showing an error. The error relates to "Empty form label, A form label is present, but does not contain any content". To address this issue I added an aria-hidden="true" to the HTML. Content hidden with aria-hidden="true" is not presented to screen reader users.
   
   2.  Media Queries - The media queries were providing some trouble with placmenet of the Hero image. This was due to a missing closing tag for one of the media queries. This caused much time spent looking to fix an issue that ultimately due to poor css or poor html. Lesson learned is to check both HTML & CSS code with validators earlier. Also learned to use IDE to format document on save so that any silly missing bracklet issues don't reoccur.
   
   3.  CSS - Refactor code tp target specific elements instead of combining element selectors. This allows targeting to be more specific, and helps code to be more reusable.
   
   4.  Number of Font-Weights:  Importing a lot of font-weights was significantly increasing the amount of CSS that would need to be loaded, which would have an impact on website performance. This was addressed by reducing the number of font-weights imported.

   5. Consistency in measurements - Reviewed and rewrote code to ensure that sizes were consistent throughout and were all using rems instead of pixels or percentages. Pixels are used for measurments less than 0.5rem.i.e. 1px, 2px, 3ps or 4px. The rem scale was reset for easier calculation with 1rem = 10px. 
   
   6. Security - Initially when a user submitted the contact form they were sent to the FormDump. This is a page showing the information the user has submitted. As an alternative we made a new Thank-you page that displays when a user submits their contact information, so this is no longer an issue.
 
   7. Time to automatically redirect from Thank-you page home page: Initially the time was set to 5 seconds. However after testing, it was felt that 5 seconds would not be enough time for users to read all of the text and choose to take an action. To avoid user frustration the automatic refresh period was increased to 10 seconds from 5 seconds.
   
## Unfixed-Bugs

    If I had a bit more time before suproject submission I would carry out the following fixes and updates:

   1. Linter setting in IDE - Fix settings on linter so that it stops adding in "Trailing slash on void elements". I had fixed this issue previously. Unfortunately, when ajusting other settings subsequently another setting has been changed causing the error to reoccur.
   2. CSS Colour variable names: Update CSS color variable names to match the names in the Coolors pallette. This woudl be done for consistency in naming and to avoid any potential confusion for future users of the code or developers.  
   3. Website performance: An area for focus in the future will be to make adjustments or refactor code to improve performance times in ine with industry best practice for:
      (i) First Contentful Paint, 
      (ii) Largest Contentful Paint, 
      (iii) Total Blocking Time, and
      (iv) Speed Index
